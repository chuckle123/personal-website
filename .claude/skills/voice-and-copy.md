# Voice & Copy

This skill defines Cameron Spencer's writing voice. All copy written for Cameron — website pages, blog posts, cover letters, bios, social posts — MUST follow these guidelines.

## Core Voice

**Direct, technical, human.** Write like a builder talking to other builders. No corporate polish. No hype. Say what happened, what broke, and what worked. Let the specifics do the convincing.

## Sentence Style

- **Short sentences by default.** Vary length for rhythm — a short punch followed by a longer explanation. Never string three long sentences in a row.
- **Declarative, not hedging.** "This doesn't work" over "I think this might not work." State things directly.
- **Em dashes over parentheses.** Use `—` to insert asides, qualifications, or pivots mid-sentence. This is a signature pattern.
- **No exclamation marks.** Enthusiasm comes from specificity, not punctuation.

## Word Choice

- **Numbers over adjectives.** "Cut errors by 65%" not "dramatically reduced errors." "17,400 tokens became ~200" not "significantly reduced token usage." Always prefer a metric.
- **Plain verbs.** "Built" not "architected." "Cut" not "reduced." "Shipped" not "delivered." Use the simplest accurate verb.
- **No corporate filler.** Never use: leverage, synergy, passion/passionate, utilize, innovative, cutting-edge, best-in-class, revolutionize, empower, ecosystem (outside of crypto context).
- **No buzzword hedging.** Never write "I believe" or "I'm passionate about" as filler. If you have an opinion, state it flat.
- **Technical terms are fine.** Don't dumb down MCP, FTS5, BigQuery, token counts. The audience is technical. But explain domain-specific concepts (e.g. what progressive disclosure means in context) briefly on first use.

## Structure

- **Lead with the concrete.** Start paragraphs with what happened, not with thesis statements. "We built an MCP server that lets AI assistants query financial metrics" — not "In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI data infrastructure."
- **Problem → attempt → result.** This is the default arc for any technical narrative. What was broken. What was tried. What it did.
- **Tables for comparisons.** When comparing approaches, trade-offs, or versions, use a table. Don't write it out in prose.
- **Bold for key principles.** When stating a takeaway or lesson, bold the first sentence of the paragraph. Use this sparingly — one or two per section max.
- **Short paragraphs.** 2-4 sentences. A single-sentence paragraph is fine for emphasis.

## Tone Calibration

- **Confident, not arrogant.** "This pattern generalizes" is fine. "I'm one of the few engineers who understands this" is not.
- **Honest about failures.** Admit what didn't work and why. "Each failure narrowed the design space" — frame failures as information, not embarrassment.
- **Dry humor, used sparingly.** "I played the referee." "Mostly because I was curious whether I could." Personality comes through in throwaway lines, not in trying to be funny.
- **No false modesty.** Don't undersell real results. "Cut order errors by 65%" — just say it. Don't add "I was fortunate to" or "the team helped me."
- **Builder's perspective always.** Write as someone who built the thing, not someone who managed the project or observed from the side. Use "I built," "we shipped," "I wrote."

## Format by Context

### Blog posts
- Open with a one-line summary of the result or thesis. Bold it.
- Use `---` horizontal rules between major sections.
- End with generalizable takeaways, bolded as principles.
- No "In this article, I will discuss." Just start.

### Website copy
- First person, casual. Short paragraphs.
- Jump to the point. No preamble on any page.
- Project descriptions: 2-3 sentences max. What it does, what it achieved, and one specific number.

### Cover letters
- Open with a hook tied to the company — something specific about their product or problem.
- Body connects experience to the role with specific metrics. Don't restate the resume — contextualize it.
- Close with a direct CTA. One sentence.

### Bios / social
- One to two sentences. Role + what you build + one memorable detail.
- Example tone: "Staff engineer building AI data tools. Previously led warehouse logistics engineering at The Rounds. Once acted in a South Indian movie."

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

- Never open with "In today's rapidly evolving..." or any variation
- Never use "I'm passionate about" — show it by describing what you built
- Never write more than two sentences without a concrete detail (a number, a tool name, a specific outcome)
- Never use "utilize" when "use" works
- Never end a blog post with "What do you think? Let me know in the comments!"
- Never write in third person unless specifically requested
- Never pad word count — if it can be said in fewer words, use fewer words
